There are to ways to create an animation:\n","\n","- By using the FuncAnimation interface, an animation is made by repeatedly calling a function func, a function where new data will be plotted. We will use this method when using the Animation module directly.\n","\n","- By using ArtistAnimation interface, all plotting should already have taken place and the results saved. This is what Celluloid uses under the hood.\n","\n","Although the basic principle of an animation is an overlay of different shapes and figures, there are different ways in which this can be done. Matplotlib allows the use of blitting, an optimization technique that renders non-changing graphic elements into a background, and only draw the changing elements. Blitting can improve the performance of interactive figures, but can become more complex to use.\n","\n","By setting blit = False, the simplest way to generate an animated plot is by clearing our figure, and plotting new data. If we don't clear the figure, it can become crowded by the old plots, as can be seen in the example below."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-05T23:56:20.613623Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-05T23:56:20.61326Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-05T23:56:23.641584Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-05T23:56:23.640938Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-05T23:56:20.613589Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=4, ncols=1, figsize=(15,8))\n","plt.tight_layout()\n","line, = axes[3].plot([], [], linewidth=5)\n","for i, ax in enumerate(axes):\n","    ax.set_ylim(0, 13)\n","    ax.set_xlim(-1, 10)\n","\n","axes[0].set_title(\"Plot 1: Clearing the axes before plotting again using the 'plot' command\", fontsize=22, y=0.75)\n","axes[1].set_title(\"Plot 2: Same as Plot 1, but setting the x and y-limits for each plot\", fontsize=22, y=0.75)\n","axes[2].set_title(\"Plot 3: Plotting new data using the 'plot' command without clearing the axes\", fontsize=22, y=0.75)\n","axes[3].set_title(\"Plot 4: Setting new data directly to the line's artist, WITHOUT using the 'plot' command\", fontsize=22, y=0.75)\n","\n","def animate(i):\n","    # Plot 1\n","    axes[0].clear()\n","    axes[0].set_title(\"Plot 1: Clearing the axes before plotting again using the 'plot' command\", fontsize=22, y=0.75)\n","    axes[0].plot([i] * 10, np.arange(10), linewidth=5)\n","    # Plot 2\n","    axes[1].clear()\n","    axes[1].set_ylim(0, 13)\n","    axes[1].set_xlim(-1, 10)\n","    axes[1].set_title(\"Plot 2: Same as Plot 1, but setting the x and y-limits for each plot\", fontsize=22, y=0.75)\n","    axes[1].plot([i] * 10, np.arange(10), linewidth=5)\n","    # Plot 3\n","    axes[2].plot([i] * 10, np.arange(10), linewidth=5, )\n","    # Plot 4\n","    line.set_data([i] * 10, np.arange(10))\n","\n","plt.close()\n","    \n","anim = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=10, interval=200, blit=False)\n","anim"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-05T23:56:23.643288Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-05T23:56:23.642519Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-05T23:56:23.646526Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-05T23:56:23.646042Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-05T23:56:23.643255Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# anim.save('matplotlib_animation_example.gif', writer='imagemagick')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Suppose that we want to plot a simple line moving across the screen.
